// Warm-up Question 7

// Consider the following 2-d matrix:  ( a b )
//                                     ( c d )   
// Write a Java program that first reads 4 doubles, representing a,b,c, and d from the keyboard. 
// It then outputs to the screen the determinant of the matrix. For a 2x2 matrix, the determinant is always equal to (a*d) - (b*c)
